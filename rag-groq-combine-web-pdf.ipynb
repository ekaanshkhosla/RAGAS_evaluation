Since you have already invested time in literature research for this topic, this will save you a lot of work effort for your Master’s thesis. Alternatively, you can also search for a Master’s thesis topic independently of your Master’s seminar.

Professors who are a secondary member in one of these listed departments can also supervise your thesis. If you are not certain if they fulfill these requirements, please ask the person directly. Your official supervisor is also the first examiner of your thesis and should propose you a second examiner for your thesis that has to fulfill the same requirements, but can be from any department at FAU. Your Master’s thesis can additionally be supervised or guided by other FAU staff, e.g., PhD students, who are working in the subject of your Master’s thesis. However, they cannot be your official supervisors.',\n",
